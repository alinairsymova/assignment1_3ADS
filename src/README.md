Factorial Calculator
Description
This program calculates the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach. It computes factorials for values less than 20 and prints the result along with the execution time.

How It Works
Uses a for loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n.

Outputs the factorial value and execution time in milliseconds.

Handles invalid input (e.g., negative numbers).

Time Complexity
O(n) (linear complexity): The algorithm iterates n times, making it proportional to the input size.

Usage
Run the program.

Enter a number (n).

View the factorial result and execution time.

Example Output
Enter number for factorial: 7
Factorial of 7 is 5040
Execution time: 0.0013
