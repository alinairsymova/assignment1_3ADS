This program calculates the factorial of a given number
Uses an iterative loop to calculate factorial
Calculate all factorials < 20
Time complexity: O(n) - linear complexity
A for loop iterates from 1 to n, multiplying each number to compute the factorial
It prints the factorial result and the execution time
